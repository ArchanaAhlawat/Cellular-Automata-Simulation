Cellular Automata Simulation

This program animates 2D cellular automata simulations. It takes in XML data input files with simulation cell states and rules for predator-prey, segregation, fire spread, and game of life simulations. Users can manipulate rates of simulation within the UI. Further information on design and specifications can be found [here](https://github.com/ArchanaAhlawat/Cellular-Automata-Simulation/blob/master/CodeReview).
